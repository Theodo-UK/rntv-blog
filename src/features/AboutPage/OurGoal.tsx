          Our goal is to create a consolidative knowledge base for developers who are interested in
          venturing into the realm of building TV apps, particularly those based on React Native.

        <p>
          Currently, there exists a noticeable gap in readily available information in this
          specialised area, making it an underloved part of the React Native ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recognise this lack and aim to fill it by establishing a centralised hub where people
          can not only find comprehensive resources and guidance but also feel like they are part of
          a community dedicated to learning and growing in this unique space.
