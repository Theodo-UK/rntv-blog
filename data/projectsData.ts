    title: 'Bringing the Best of React to TV Navigation: A React-Like Solution for Remote Control',
    description: `Have you ever wondered how Netflix navigates within a page with a remote? When you press an arrow button, how does it know which element to focus on?
    We had to build this for our TV replay app (using RN) and made it the React way.
    Our challenge was to build on top of the React tree our own tree containing the elements that are focusable with the remote.
    Through trial and error, we developed a new declarative approach. We'll share the steps we took to synchronise the React tree with the spatial TV layout.
    By the end of this talk, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the subtleties of React, learn how to simplify complicated logic with a declarative API and discover the non-trivial considerations involved in syncing the React tree with another one.

The topic covers a general overview of how we achieved this and our plans to take it to more platforms.
